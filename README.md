# Endless
Technical Assessment for "Endless".

# Requirements
1. ~~Download the design comp and assets: https://github.com/singlestone/front-end-technical-exercise-assets~~
2. ~~Download the font: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato~~
3. ~~You will be creating a responsive website using Angular, React, or Vue~~
4. ~~Add hover and active state transitions to the “Get Started” button. The state transitions should include a slight color
change over a short duration and should be implemented with CSS only.~~
5. ~~The “How It Works” section will be constructed using the steps retrieved from the API. They will be displayed according
to the criteria listed below. Note that the “How it Works” headline is static.~~
a. ~~Sort the steps in order by the “stepNumber” value~~
b. ~~Extract the content version with the most recent “effectiveDate” value~~
c. ~~Simplify the “step” objects in the resulting array so that extraneous data is removed~~
6. ~~The website must work with latest stable version of Google Chrome~~
7. ~~Upload all files to GitHub, create a README with instructions for building and running the project, and provide a link to
us for review~~


# THINGS WE ARE LOOKING FOR
1. ~~Site should look good at every resolution above 320px~~
2. ~~There should be judicious use of tools, libraries, and frameworks (no bloat)~~
3. ~~Code should be well-organized and clean (minimize cruft)~~
4. ~~We have a strong preference for “vanilla” JavaScript in the implementation of the “How it Works” steps (instead of
leveraging an external library such as lodash.js)~~
5. ~~We have a strong preference for achieving responsiveness in this exercise without the use of a responsive framework
like Bootstrap~~

# BONUS POINTS
1. ~~Write a unit test to verify the logic for building the list of steps~~
2. Maintaining a small file size for the site by using minification, compressing images, etc.
3. Optimizing images for different DPI screens
4. Creativity: Any extra features you want to add in order to showcase your skills (e.g. parallax scrolling)

# Angular Endless App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
